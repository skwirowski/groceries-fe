# Grocery shopping list web application.

## Reasoning behind this application

I really don't like the shopping lists applications I used don't have live update of the list. You can never be sure if groceries you have added to the list are available for the other person sharing the list with you. I'm going to solve this issue here. Application is going to be simple and use live update, so you can update list anytime and person doing the shopping will see the updates.

## Basic assumptions

- web application
- usage of firebase for data storage, logging, hosting etc.
- react js as front-end building tool
- deployed application address: https://groceries-b4c0b.web.app/
- authentication fields validation
- more soon during the development

## Technology

- [React](https://pl.reactjs.org/) web application
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) boilerplate with TypeScript support
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) integration
- [MUI](https://mui.com/) design library
- [Lint-staged & Husky](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged#installation-and-setup) for git hooks
